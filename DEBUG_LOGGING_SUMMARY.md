# Debug Logging - What's Included

## Quick Summary

The debug logging includes **8 categories of messages** that trace the entire parsing process from start to finish.

---

## 📋 All Debug Log Categories

### 1. **File Parsing Start**
```
📄 DEBUG: Parsing file: tests/playwright/output/junit-results.xml
```
- Shows which file is being processed
- Useful to confirm the right file is being read

---

### 2. **Raw XML Structure**
```
🔍 DEBUG: Parsed XML structure: {
  "testsuites": {
    "testsuite": [...]
  }
}
```
- Shows the exact XML structure after parsing
- Helps diagnose XML format issues
- Useful if tests aren't being detected

---

### 3. **XML Root Element Detection**
```
🔍 DEBUG: xmlData.testsuites: true
🔍 DEBUG: xmlData.testsuite: false
```
- Tells you which root element was found
- Shows if XML structure is recognized
- Both false = unrecognized format

---

### 4. **Processing Mode Selection**
```
🔍 DEBUG: Processing testsuites -> testsuite
```
Options:
- `Processing testsuites -> testsuite` (root is `<testsuites>` with nested `<testsuite>`)
- `Processing root testsuite` (root is `<testsuite>` directly)
- `Processing direct test results` (root is `<testcase>` elements)

---

### 5. **Suite Discovery**
```
🔍 DEBUG: Found 1 test suites
```
- Number of test suite elements found
- If 0: XML structure not recognized
- If > 0: Suites detected successfully

---

### 6. **Suite Details**
```
🔍 DEBUG: Suite "dashboard.spec.ts" - tests: 2, failures: 0, errors: 0, skipped: 0
```
Shows for each suite:
- Suite name
- Total tests declared in metadata
- Failures count (from metadata)
- Errors count (from metadata)
- Skipped count (from metadata)

**What's expected:** Numbers should match actual test results

---

### 7. **Test Case Extraction**
```
🔍 DEBUG: Suite has 2 test cases
```
- How many individual `<testcase>` elements in this suite
- If 0 but metadata says tests > 0: test cases not being found
- If > 0: test cases successfully extracted

---

### 8. **Suite Completion Summary**
```
🔍 DEBUG: Suite complete - total: 2, passed: 2, failed: 0, skipped: 0
```
Final counts after processing:
- `total`: Total tests in suite
- `passed`: Passed test count
- `failed`: Failed test count
- `skipped`: Skipped test count

**Validation:** total = passed + failed + skipped

---

### 9. **Final Parsing Summary**
```
🔍 DEBUG: Parsing complete - 1 suites, total tests: 2
```
- Number of suites parsed
- Total number of tests found across all suites
- Indicates successful completion

## 🎯 Complete Debug Output Example

Here's what a **full debug session looks like**:

```
✅ Parsed tests/playwright/output/junit-results.xml (junit) - found 1 suites with 2 tests

🔍 DEBUG: Parsed XML structure: {
  "testsuites": {
    "testsuite": {
      "name": "dashboard.spec.ts",
      "tests": "2",
      "failures": "0",
      "errors": "0",
      "skipped": "0",
      "time": "22.7",
      "testcase": [
        {"name": "test1", "time": "11.35"},
        {"name": "test2", "time": "11.35"}
      ]
    }
  }
}

🔍 DEBUG: xmlData.testsuites: true
🔍 DEBUG: xmlData.testsuite: false

🔍 DEBUG: Processing testsuites -> testsuite

🔍 DEBUG: Found 1 test suites

🔍 DEBUG: Processing suite: {"name":"dashboard.spec.ts","tests":"2","failures":"0",...}

🔍 DEBUG: Suite "dashboard.spec.ts" - tests: 2, failures: 0, errors: 0, skipped: 0

🔍 DEBUG: Suite has 2 test cases

🔍 DEBUG: Suite complete - total: 2, passed: 2, failed: 0, skipped: 0

🔍 DEBUG: Parsing complete - 1 suites, total tests: 2
```

---

## 🔍 Where to Find Debug Logs

### In GitHub Actions Web UI
1. Go to your workflow run
2. Click the job that ran your tests
3. Expand the "Test Metrics" step
4. Scroll and look for lines starting with `🔍 DEBUG:`

### In Local Terminal
```bash
DEBUG_METRICS=true npm run build
DEBUG_METRICS=true node dist/index.js
```

Look for any line with `🔍 DEBUG:` prefix

## 🧪 Debugging Checklist

When something isn't working, check these in order:

### ✓ Step 1: File Detection
```
📄 DEBUG: Parsing file: [your-file]
```
- Is this the right file?
- Does the path exist?

### ✓ Step 2: XML Structure
```
🔍 DEBUG: Parsed XML structure: {...}
🔍 DEBUG: xmlData.testsuites: true/false
🔍 DEBUG: xmlData.testsuite: true/false
```
- Can you see the XML structure?
- Is it valid JUnit format?

### ✓ Step 3: Suite Detection
```
🔍 DEBUG: Found X test suites
```
- Are suites being found?
- If 0, XML structure not recognized

### ✓ Step 4: Test Case Extraction
```
🔍 DEBUG: Suite has X test cases
```
- Are test cases being extracted?
- If 0, check if testcases exist in XML

### ✓ Step 5: Status Detection
```
🔍 DEBUG: Suite complete - total: X, passed: Y, failed: Z, skipped: W
```
- Do the counts match expectations?
- Does total = passed + failed + skipped?

### ✓ Step 6: Final Summary
```
🔍 DEBUG: Parsing complete - X suites, total tests: Y
```
- Is the final count correct?
- Should match actual tests in XML

## 💡 Common Debug Patterns

### Pattern 1: "0 tests detected"
Look for:
```
🔍 DEBUG: Found 0 test suites
```
**Solution:** Check if your XML has `<testsuites>` or `<testsuite>` element

---

### Pattern 2: "Suites found but no tests extracted"
Look for:
```
🔍 DEBUG: Found 1 test suites
🔍 DEBUG: Suite has 0 test cases
```
**Solution:** Check if `<testcase>` elements exist in your XML

---

### Pattern 3: "Test counts don't match"
Look for mismatch:
```
🔍 DEBUG: Suite "name" - tests: 5, failures: 1, errors: 0, skipped: 1
🔍 DEBUG: Suite complete - total: 5, passed: 3, failed: 1, skipped: 0
```
(passed + failed + skipped ≠ total)

**Solution:** Status detection may have an issue

---

## 🎛️ Controlling Debug Output

### Enable Debug Logging

**Option 1:** Environment variable
```bash
export DEBUG_METRICS=true
```

**Option 2:** GitHub Actions
```yaml
env:
  DEBUG_METRICS: 'true'
```

**Option 3:** GitHub Debug mode
```yaml
env:
  RUNNER_DEBUG: '1'
```

### Disable Debug Logging

Just remove the environment variable or set to false:
```bash
unset DEBUG_METRICS
# or
export DEBUG_METRICS=false
```

---

## 📊 Performance Impact

- **When disabled (default):** 0ms overhead
- **When enabled:** < 50ms per file parsed
- **Typical run:** 1-2 files = 50-100ms overhead
- **Impact:** Negligible for CI/CD pipelines

---

- ✅ File parsing confirmation
- ✅ Raw XML structure inspection
- ✅ Root element detection
- ✅ Processing mode identification
- ✅ Suite discovery count
- ✅ Suite metadata breakdown
- ✅ Test case extraction count
- ✅ Final status summary
- ✅ Completion confirmation
